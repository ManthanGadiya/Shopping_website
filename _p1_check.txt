Preliminary Investigation 
 
1.1 Problem Identification and Definition 
In today’s fast-paced world, pet owners often struggle to find a reliable and efficient way to 
meet their pet’s needs. Traditional pet stores have several limitations such as restricted 
operating hours, limited inventory, and lack of personalized customer service. Additionally, 
geographical location can make it difficult for pet owners in remote or urban areas to 
access high-quality pet supplies. 
Many pet owners also lack proper guidance when it comes to pet care, diet, and health, 
which leads to incorrect purchases. Current online platforms often fall short in offering 
recommendations, choices, etc. 
By addressing these challenges, the Online Pet Shop seeks to enhance accessibility, 
convenience, and overall pet ownership experience, ensuring that pets and their owners 
receive the best possible care and support. 
 
1.2 Problem Description 
 
Issues in the current manual/physical shop system: 
 
1. Limited Accessibility (Restricted to Shop Hours) 
Customers can only purchase products during the physical shop’s working hours. This creates 
difficulties for people who work late, live far away, or need emergency pet supplies outside of 
business hours. 
 
 
2. No Centralized Record of Customers, Orders, and Services 

--- PAGE 4 ---
The existing system does not maintain proper digital records of customer details, past orders, or 
service usage. This makes it hard to analyse customer behaviour, provide personalized offers, or 
track regular requirements like repeat purchases of food or medicines. 
 
 
3. Manual Inventory Tracking Leads to Stock Errors 
Since most shops still record stock manually, mistakes are common. Products may run out 
without the shopkeeper realizing, leading to stock shortages. On the other hand, some products 
may be overstocked, causing wastage of resources and storage space. 
 
4.Customer Relationship Gap 
Traditional shops rarely keep track of customer purchase history or preferences. As a result, 
they cannot provide loyalty discounts, personalized offers, or subscription-based packages 
(e.g., monthly dog food delivery). This reduces long-term customer retention and satisfaction. 
 
 
1.3 Fact-Finding Techniques 
 
1. Observation 
Direct visits to local pet shops and veterinary clinics can help in understanding how customers 
currently purchase products and avail services. By observing customer behaviour, waiting 
times, and transaction handling, one can identify the shortcomings of the manual system. For 
example, noticing frequent customer complaints about out-of-stock products highlights the 
need for a digital inventory system. 
 
 
2. Interviews 
Talking directly with pet owners, shopkeepers, veterinarians, and grooming staff provides first-
hand information about their needs, problems, and expectations. Shopkeepers may mention 
difficulties in stock management, while customers may stress on the need for online delivery or 
appointment booking. Such interviews give valuable insights into system requirements. 
 
 
3. Questionnaires / Surveys 
Distributing surveys (online or offline) to pet owners can help collect large-scale data about 
their preferences. Questions can include: 

--- PAGE 5 ---
How often do you purchase pet supplies? 
Would you prefer home delivery of pet food and medicines? 
How important is online appointment booking for grooming/vet services? 
What payment methods do you prefer (cash, UPI, card)? 
Analysing this data ensures the system is designed according to actual customer needs. 
 
 
4. Document Review 
Reviewing competitor websites, online pet care platforms, and industry reports provides useful 
secondary data. It helps in understanding what features are commonly offered (like product 
categories, adoption listings, and delivery options) and what gaps exist in the market. Studying 
such documents also ensures that the new system includes modern features and 
remains competitive. 
 
 
1.4 Drawbacks of Existing System 
 
1. Paper-Based Registration and Billing 
In the current system, most small pet shops record sales and customer details on paper or in 
basic notebooks. This leads to data loss, human errors, and difficulties in tracking customer 
history or repeated purchases. Over time, managing these records becomes highly inefficient. 
 
 
2. No Digital Record of Customers, Orders, or Inventory 
Since there is no centralized digital database, shopkeepers cannot access detailed information 
about past sales, current stock, or customer behaviour. This prevents data-driven decision 
making, personalized offers, or loyalty programs, which are common in modern online 
platforms. 
 
 
3. No Online Payment  
Customers are restricted to physical payments, usually cash, when purchasing products or 
booking services. With the increasing trend of digital transactions (UPI, debit/credit cards, net 
banking), the lack of online payment support makes the system outdated and less convenient.. 
 

--- PAGE 6 ---
 
4. Time-Consuming and Error-Prone Processes 
Manual entry of sales, orders, and appointments consumes a lot of time for both shop staff and 
customers. Mistakes like incorrect billing, mismanaged stock updates, or lost appointment 
details are common. This reduces overall efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
1.5 Scope of the Proposed System 
 
The Online Pet Shop will provide: 
 
1. Wide Range of Pet Supplies 
The system will allow customers to browse and purchase a variety of products such as pet food, 
grooming items, medicines, toys, and accessories. Categories will be well-organized, making it 
easy to search and compare products. 
 
2. Doorstep Delivery of Pet Products 
The system will integrate a delivery service where customers can receive their orders at home. 
Delivery status updates and tracking features will improve customer satisfaction and trust. 
 
3. Customer Accounts and Order Tracking 
Each registered customer will have an account to view their order history, track ongoing 
deliveries, and manage appointments. This improves transparency and enhances user 
experience. 
 
4. Online Payments and Multiple Modes of Transaction 
The platform will support secure online payments through UPI, debit/credit cards, net banking, 
and digital wallets. Customers can also opt for cash on delivery. This flexibility ensures 
convenience and caters to different user preferences. 
 
5. Special Offers, Discounts, and Subscriptions 
Customers can benefit from loyalty programs, discount coupons, and subscription packages 
(e.g., monthly food delivery). These features will increase customer retention and ensure regular 
sales for the business. 
 
6. Feedback Collection and Continuous Improvement 

--- PAGE 7 ---
After every purchase or service, customers will be able to rate their experience and leave 
suggestions. This feedback will help administrators improve product quality, service efficiency, 
and overall customer satisfaction. 
 
 
7. Scalability for Future Expansion 
The proposed system will be designed to handle more users, products, and services in the 
future. It can also integrate advanced features like AI-based pet care tips, live vet consultations, 
or GPS tracking for pet safety. 
 
 
1.6 Feasibility Study 
 
A feasibility study ensures that the proposed system is practical, cost-effective, and can be 
implemented successfully within the available resources and time. The following aspects are 
considered: 
 
1. Technical Feasibility 
The proposed system is technically feasible because: 
It can be developed using widely available technologies such as web applications (HTML, CSS, 
PHP , etc.) and a relational database (MySQL). 
Hosting can be done on affordable cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or even shared hosting 
providers. 
No specialized or high-end hardware is required. A normal PC or laptop for administrators and a 
mobile/desktop browser for customers are sufficient. 
Existing open-source frameworks and payment gateway integrations ( PayPal ) make 
development faster and reliable. 
Thus, there are no major technical barriers to implementing the system. 
 
2. Economic Feasibility 
The system is cost-effective because: 
Initial development can be done at a low cost using open-source tools and frameworks. 
Hosting and domain charges are relatively affordable. 
Compared to manual record-keeping, the system reduces costs related to paper, printing, and 
physical storage. 

--- PAGE 8 ---
Automation of tasks like inventory management, billing, and notifications saves manpower 
costs. 
Online marketing and digital presence can increase sales and revenue, balancing the 
investment quickly. 
Therefore, the project is economically viable. 
 
 
3. Operational Feasibility 
The system is easy to operate and manage because: 
Customers will find the interface user-friendly, with clear navigation for shopping and making 
payments. 
Shop administrators can easily update products, manage stock, and handle appointments 
without requiring advanced technical skills. 
Automated notifications reduce human errors and ensure smooth operations. 
Training requirements for staff are minimal since the system is designed with simplicity in mind. 
Hence, the system is operationally practical and can be adopted smoothly. 
 
4. Time Feasibility 
The project can be completed within a reasonable time frame, depending on the scope: 
A basic version (product listings, orders, payments, simple appointment booking) can be 
developed within 2–3 weeks. 
A full-featured version (adoption listings, loyalty programs, advanced notifications) may take 1–
2 months with proper planning. 
Since the tools required are easily available and the design is straightforward, deadlines can be 
met without significant delays. 
Thus, the project is time-feasible and can be delivered on schedule.
